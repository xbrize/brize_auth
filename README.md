# Brize Auth

A simple to use async basic auth and session library for MySql and SurrealDB.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Database
  - [ ] Authentication
    - [x] User Schema
    - [x] User Registration
    - [x] Login
    - [x] Session Management
    - [ ] Logout
    - [ ] Delete User
  - Authorization
    - [ ] Roles Schema

## Setup

Start Development Database, Non-Persist, No-Auth

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start
```

## Test

Run test scripts

```bash
scripts/tests/test.<test-name>.sh
```

## Flow

### Step 1: Designing the Database Schema

Define a database schema to store user information. At a minimum, this schema should include fields for a user ID, username, and hashed password.

1. User table: This should include columns such as `id`, `username`, `hashed_password`, `email`, and `created_at`.
2. Role table (optional): This would store different roles that users can have within the system.
3. User_Role table (optional): A junction table to link users with their respective roles.

### Step 2: Implementing User Registration

Implement the user registration feature, which allows new users to create accounts.

1. Validation: Validate user inputs, like checking if the email format is correct.
2. Password hashing: Use a strong cryptographic hash function (like bcrypt or Argon2) to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
3. User creation: Create a new user record in the database.

### Step 3: Implementing User Authentication

Implement the user authentication feature, which allows users to log in to their accounts.

1. Input collection: Collect the username and password from the user.
2. User lookup: Retrieve the user record from the database based on the username.
3. Password verification: Use the hash function to verify that the hashed version of the inputted password matches the hashed password stored in the database.
4. Session creation: If the password is correct, create a new session for the user.

### Step 4: Implementing Session Management

Implement session management to maintain a user's authenticated state across multiple requests.

1. Session creation: When a user successfully logs in, create a session and associate it with the user.
2. Session storage: Store the session information, either in a database or in-memory data store.
3. Session validation: Validate the session on each request to ensure that the user is authenticated.

### Step 5: Implementing Authorization (optional)

Implement authorization to control access to certain resources based on a user's roles or permissions.

1. Role assignment: Assign roles to users during registration or through an admin interface.
2. Permission checking: Check the user's permissions before allowing access to certain resources.

### Step 6: Implementing Logout Functionality

Implement a logout feature to allow users to end their sessions.

1. Session destruction: Destroy the user's session when they log out.
2. Cookie clearing: Clear any authentication cookies from the user's browser.

### Step 7: Testing

Test your authentication system thoroughly to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.

1. Unit testing: Write unit tests for individual components.
2. Integration testing: Write integration tests to test the system as a whole.

### Step 8: Deployment

Deploy your authentication service to a production environment, ensuring to use secure connections (HTTPS) and following other security best practices.

### Step 9: Maintenance

Regularly update your authentication system to patch vulnerabilities and improve security.

Remember, building a secure authentication system from scratch can be challenging, and it's often a good idea to use established libraries or frameworks to help with this. Also, always ensure to follow the latest security best practices and guidelines.

## User Table

### Schema

#### Verbose Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                     -- Unique identifier for each user
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,      -- Unique username
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,        -- Unique email address
    hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,     -- Hashed password (never store plain text passwords)
    salt VARCHAR(255),                         -- Salt for the hash function (if not included in the hashed password)
    first_name VARCHAR(100),                   -- First name (optional)
    last_name VARCHAR(100),                    -- Last name (optional)
    date_of_birth DATE,                        -- Date of birth (optional, consider privacy implications)
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Account creation timestamp
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Account update timestamp
    last_login TIMESTAMP,                      -- Last login timestamp (optional)
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'banned', 'deleted') NOT NULL, -- Account status
    role ENUM('user', 'admin', 'editor') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user', -- User role (for permission levels)
    failed_login_attempts INT DEFAULT 0,       -- To track failed login attempts (for security features)
    reset_password_token VARCHAR(255),         -- Token for reset password functionality (optional)
    reset_password_expiry TIMESTAMP,           -- Expiry time for reset password token (optional)
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,      -- To track if the email address is verified (optional)
    email_verification_token VARCHAR(255),     -- Token for email verification (optional)
    CONSTRAINT chk_status CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'banned', 'deleted')), -- Check constraint for status
    CONSTRAINT chk_role CHECK (role IN ('user', 'admin', 'editor'))  -- Check constraint for role
);
```
